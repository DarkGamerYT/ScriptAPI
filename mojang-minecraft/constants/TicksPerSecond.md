	// as player has joined set worldHasPlayer to yes
	worldHasPlayer = true
})

const TICKS_IN_FIVE_SECONDS = TicksPerSecond * 5

// world tick event that fires our function every tick - 20 time in a sec
world.events.tick.subscribe(eventData => {

	// current world tick count value returned by the event
	const { currentTick } = eventData
	
	// if world not has player or current tick is not divisable by TICKS_IN_FIVE_SECONDS the break the code
	if (!worldHasPlayer || currentTick % TICKS_IN_FIVE_SECONDS !== 0) return;
